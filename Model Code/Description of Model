The code for a Siamese Neural Network that was trained to detect grayscaled images of Jerma.


This specific iteration was found suitable for detecting images of Jerma resized using "tf.image.resize(image, (100, 100))" at a 98% confidence threshold in Youtube videos.


This folder contains the Google Colab notebook used to preprocess the data, create the model architecture, train the model, evaluate the model, and run the model on Youtube videos.
