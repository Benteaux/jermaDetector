To train my model, I used:

1. Approximately 3000 images of Jerma, collected from Youtube, augmented.
2. LFW Dataset (can be found online but not in this repository), unaugmented.
3. Random images from random Youtube videos without Jerma's face in them, augmented and unaugmented


In this folder there is a folder containing unaugmented (but resized) images of Jerma, augmented images of Jerma, augmented negative training data, and unaugmented negative training data.
